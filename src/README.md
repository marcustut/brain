# Introduction

This book serves as a location in memory where I offload revisit-able knowledge from my brain. All the content are public hosted at [brain](https://www.github.com/marcustut/brain) and the site is powered by [mbBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).

## Motivation

I like to dabble into technical topics and sometimes even think of them in terms of code or architecture diagrams. However, some thoughts just blush off quickly and I need a way to record them down, as a person who dislikes writing with pen and paper, it was the natural choice for me to record them down on my laptop.

Hopefully, I am starting my postgraduate studies at the fall of 2023 and this book would serve as a good place for me to keep my findings along the journey of Computer Science research.
